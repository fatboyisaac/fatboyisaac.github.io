    <img style="float:right; border: solid 4px green; border-style: dotted; width: 45%;" src="walloftears.jpg"/>
    <p>Between the years 1945 and 1959, a monument called, “The Wall of Tears.” Something that is special about this construction is that it was developed by prisoners. The island used to be utilized as a prison colony by the government to keep their prisoners busy. Subsequently, the administration forced their prisoners to create a rigid stone wall. The working conditions were utterly and excruciatingly relentless. The temperature was extremely hot and humid, so we could imagine how brutal the working conditions were. Today, it serves as a recollection of the dark past of the island. It’s very important to bring water on the way to your adventure. It is estiamted to be approximately 100 meters long. Take a hike there any appreciate the green world full of life around you.
